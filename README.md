<h2> Description </h2>
<p> This was my first time using jQuery for a project, I have been learning it on the side and saw the opportunity to try out my new skills on this project. The base structure is made up from Bootstrap to help with responsiveness but then I styled it with custom CSS and adobe fonts to make it more visually appealing for users.<p>
